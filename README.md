# FindYourSeat
My first website that helped me to manage my wedding table plan and helped guests to find their seat.

# Our issue to solve
My wife and me need to manage our guests seats and facilitate them to find their own seat. We began to prepare our wedding table plan in a sheet of paper and we realize that will be a cumbersome work to make a nicely done table plan.

As a developer, it was obvious to make a website to help us.

# Technologies
I don't use any framework for this website. That was my first website, I wanted to make it simple and begin with the basics to grow better with others frameworks.
So I clearly use :

![CSS3](https://img.shields.io/badge/css3-%231572B6.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=css3&logoColor=white)
![JavaScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/javascript-%23323330.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=javascript&logoColor=%23F7DF1E)

# Internationalization
I used internationalization (i18n) that the site suits for each guests. I have 4 languages English, French, Turkish, Dutch.
You can find all about internationalization management in the folder `./i18n`
